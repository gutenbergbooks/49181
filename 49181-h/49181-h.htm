<h2>THE FOOL<br /><br />

<i>ACT I.</i></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The Church of the Nativity. New York.</i></p>

<p><i>The set, representing only the chancel, is as deep as possible, so
that, even when its foreground is brightly illuminated, the detail
back of that is lost in shadows. Pierced by three fine stained glass
windows, the rear wall looms above the altar, on which the candles
are not lighted. In front of that is the sanctuary, and, in front of
that, the communion rail, with three steps to the stage. Just right
of these steps is a very tall and beautiful Christmas tree. The tree
has been expensively trimmed, and has a practical connection for an
electric-lighted ornament still to be placed at its top. Down R., a
door to the choir room, and, down L., a door to the parish house and
the street. These doors are exactly alike. Down L., two folding wooden
chairs that have been brought in for temporary use. A tall stepladder
L. of the tree, facing front. Down R., two wooden boxes of ornaments,
that on top open and half emptied. There is a pile of tissue-wrapped
and ribboned packages under the tree, and a general litter of gifts,
boxes, and crumpled paper everywhere. The Church of the Nativity is
fashionable and luxurious;</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<i>the effect of the set must be that of a
peeping into a building spacious, magnificent, and majestic.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">At Rise</span>: <i>Christmas Eve, 1918. The act begins in bright
day-light&mdash;about half past three in the afternoon&mdash;so that the early
winter twilight may have set in before its end. The sun's rays now
come through a stained-glass window above the door L., so that the
R. of the stage is bathed in white, the C. in blue, and the L. in
a deep straw. Two women and a girl are discovered.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Henry
Gilliam</span>, <i>bending over the box down L., is fat, forty, rich and
self-satisfied. Her daughter</i>, <span class="smcap">Daffodil</span>, <i>commonly called
"Dilly," perched upon the ladder, is a "flapper." As regards her
mind, this means that, at twenty, she is wise and witty, cynical and
confident, worldly and material beyond her elders. Physically, she is
pretty, and, of course, has not hesitated to help out nature wherever
she has thought it advisable. Considering what has been spent on her
education, she is surprisingly ignorant and discourteous, particularly
to her mother, who bores her dreadfully.</i> <span class="smcap">Leila Thornbury</span>
<i>is a divorcee; thirty, smart, good-looking, with something feverish
in her face, in her eyes, in her movements. Deliberately attractive
to men, she is disliked, in proportion, by women. All three are very
expensively dressed. Mrs. Thornbury has laid aside a fur coat on the
cost of which twenty families might have lived a year. She is at the
end of the stage, concerned with a number of dolls and other toys.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning with some ornament, on a level with her eyes she observes a
generous view of</i> <span class="smcap">Dilly's</span> <i>nether limbs</i>]: Dilly, for pity's
sake, pull down your skirt! [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Dilly</span> <i>pays no attention,
she continues to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span>] I don't know what skirts
are coming to!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>They're not coming to the ground, mother. You can be sure of <em>that</em>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>What <em>I</em> can't understand is why our young women want to go around
looking like chorus girls!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>Perhaps they've noticed the kind of men that marry chorus girls.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>Salesmanship, mother, begins with a willingness to show goods.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Dilly! <em>Pull down your skirt!</em></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>I can't! That's all there is; there isn't any more!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>[<i>Holding up two dolls</i>]: What are we going to do with these?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>[<i>Despairingly surveying the profusion</i>]: Goodness knows!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>I've two engagements before dinner, and I've got to go home and
undress for the opera.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p><em>I</em> gave up a dance for this.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>A dance at this hour?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>People dance at any hour, mother.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>What do they do it for?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>For something to do. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span>] <em>We're</em> young and
we've got to have life and gaiety; haven't we, Mrs. Thornbury?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>We've got to have something. I don't know what it is, but I know we
have to keep going to get it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>But you all waste your time so dreadfully. I'm busy, too, but my life
is given to the service of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>What could be sweeter?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Dilly! Nobody knows better than you that I've never had a selfish
thought! Mr. Gilliam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>Of the Gilliam Groceries, Inc.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p><em>Mr. Gilliam</em> says I'm far <em>too</em> good!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>We agree with him, Mrs. Gilliam.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Only yesterday I gave five hundred pounds of coffee and sugar to the
Salvation Army!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>And today father jumped the price of sugar to thirty-two cents!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>Now&mdash;Dilly!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>[<i>With rising emotion</i>]: One gets precious little reward.... I can
tell you! I sent helpful thoughts from the Bible to all Mr. Gilliam's
employes! Now they're on strike, and the man that got "Be content with
your wages" is leading the strikers!... Where's the Star of Bethlehem?
[<i>To conceal her agitation, she has turned to the box.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>It doesn't work, mother.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>Are those your husband's men&mdash;on the front steps?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Oh, no! Those are people from the sweat shops! They're starving, I
hear, and Mr. Gilliam says it serves 'em right! [<i>Bringing forth a
small case</i>] What's the matter with the Star of Bethlehem?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>Oh, the usual! Whoever heard of the lights working on a Christmas Tree?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>[<i>Holding up the star</i>]: But this <em>must</em> work. Mrs. Tice had it made
to order&mdash;of Parisian diamonds. It cost a hundred dollars.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reaching for the gewgaw</i>]: All right! It's better than nothing!
[<i>She takes it, and starts to ascend</i>] Hold the ladder, mother! It
wiggles! [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span> <i>obeys</i>.]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>[<i>She has ribboned both dolls, and sets that just finished beside its
companion on the chair</i>]: There! [<i>Rises</i>] I'm half dead, and there
<em>can't</em> be any more presents! [<i>Starts up for her coat</i>] I'd give my
left hand for a cigarette!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Not here!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>I don't know why not. We've had almost everything else.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>Mother's so <em>Mid-Victorian</em>! And ministers are finding they've got to
do <em>something</em> to make church-going attractive. What do we get out of
it now? I've heard of preachers who go in for dances and movies, and
they draw crowds, too. Naturally! Who wouldn't go to church to get a
squint at Douglas Fairbanks? [<i>She has hung the star</i>] I'm through!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Then come down.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dilly</span></p>

<p>Believe me, I'm glad to get off this thing! [<i>She descends
unsteadily</i>] When I think I broke an engagement with the best
fox-trotter in New York to do a shimmy with a ladder&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span>, <i>package-laden, enters L. He is the sexton,
and of the age, manner and appearance peculiar to sextons</i>] Oh, Mr.
Barnaby!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turns and is appalled at his burden</i>]: What have you got?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>Some more presents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Good Lord!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>[<i>Deposits his bundles on the steps L.C.</i>]: Mrs. Tice brought
them. She and Mr. Jerry Goodkind. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span> <i>nudges</i>
<span class="smcap">Dilly</span>] They're just coming in.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sotto voce</i>]: Dilly, powder your nose! [<span class="smcap">Dilly</span> <i>takes her
bag from the communion rail, and obeys</i>] Mr. Barnaby, our star won't
light. Will you see if you can fix it? [<span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby's</span> <i>mind
is on</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span>. <i>She is much too rich to open a door. He is
edging L.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Thornbury</span></p>

<p>And Mr. Barnaby&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Voices off L.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>One moment!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>He opens the door L. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span> <i>followed

just entered middle-age, and refuses to shut the door
behind her. Her wealth, which has given her an air of
great authority, has made it possible for her to look a
smartly-dressed young matron. The truth is that she is
clinging to youth in an ever-lessening hope of "keeping"
her husband. Beneath the "air of authority" is something
cowed, and worried, and unhappy. Just so, beneath the
smiling, careless surface of</i> <span class="smcap">Jerry</span> <i>lies iron.
He can be</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<i>very ugly when he wishes, and he is always
sufficiently determined to get what he wants, though
he gets it generally by showing the urbane surface.</i>
<span class="smcap">Jerry</span> <i>would describe himself as a "kidder." He
is 35; sleek, well-groomed, and perfectly satisfied with
himself. His most engaging point is a perpetual smile.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span></p>

<p>Hello, everybody! [<i>"Everybody" returns the greeting</i>] Who are those
people on the church steps? A lot of dirty foreigners blocking the
sidewalk!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>It's the grating, Mrs. Tice. The furnace room's underneath, and
they're trying to keep warm.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span></p>

<p>Well, let 'em try somewhere else! [<i>Recollection of unpleasant contact

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span></p>

<p>And since then&mdash;well, frankly, Doctor, John was very much upset about
last Sunday's sermon. Mr. Gilchrist preached from the text about the
rich man entering the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Always a trifle dangerous.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span></p>

<p>Yes, and last Sunday it seemed as if he were directing <em>all</em> his
remarks at John. We're in the first pew, you know, and John says he
doesn't like to complain, but there's getting to be altogether too
much of this&mdash;Bolshevism. John says the preachers are more than half
to blame for the present social unrest. I heard the sermon, and I
agree with John that some of it was positively insulting!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist is young.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist is a nut!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span></p>

<p>Do you know what he said, Doctor? He said all this&mdash;"decking the
church"&mdash;was making an accomplice of God. He said we couldn't take
credit to ourselves for returning a small portion of our <em>ill-gotten
gains</em>!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p><em>Small portion!</em> When I've just given away five hundred pounds of
coffee!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span></p>

<p>He said charity wasn't giving away what you didn't want!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>It was <em>good</em> coffee, too! Our second best coffee!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Tice</span></p>

<p>Of course, what John objected to was the reference to rents&mdash;to
charging clerks and bookkeepers more than they could pay for "wretched
little flats." John says he doesn't come here to be told how to run
his business!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gilliam</span></p>

<p>Quite right! And I don't pay seven thousand dollars a year to hear my
husband's coffee roasted!</p>

there's such a crush of undesirable people in the galleries you can
hardly get to your pew. We don't have that trouble with Dr. Wadham!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>Now that's admitted, let's go on.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist isn't exactly poverty-stricken!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>No; he got quite a lot of money from his father. You like him and when
you said "yes," you thought you were getting somebody you liked, and
all the rest of it, too. But something's gone wrong with Gilchrist,
and you know it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Why do you say that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>Because, if you didn't before, you heard this afternoon. I saw you
standing in the door. And I'm going to tell you a few things more!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>I don't want to listen!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>Maybe&mdash;but you will! Do you know that your young trouble-hunter has
given away nearly one-tenth of his capital in three months?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>No, and I don't believe it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>All right; ask my father! The old man has his money in trust!
Gilchrist won't touch his income from Gilliam Groceries, because
they're profiteering, and he's preaching such anarchy that both
wardens are coming this afternoon to complain to Dr. Wadham! I don't
want you to throw yourself away on a raving bug!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>And your advice is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>Marry me. I'm a nice fellow, too&mdash;and I can give you what you really
care about. You're over your ears in debt, without any chance of
paying up&mdash;or cutting down. And you are, shall we say, twenty-nine in
October? I know what it cost you when your father died, and you had to
come down a peg. You don't want to keep on&mdash;coming down, <em>do</em> you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>And so&mdash;you advise me to marry you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him squarely and significantly</i>]: Knowing all I <em>do</em> know

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>I don't see how <em>that</em> concerns you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>It proves you don't love me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>You haven't said one word of love.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jerry</span></p>

<p>I've said: "What's the use bluffing?" I'm no movie hero&mdash;and no crazy
dreamer. I'm a little shop-worn, perhaps&mdash;maybe, a little soiled&mdash;but
I'm sane, and I'm solvent. You're good-looking, and smart, and a lady.

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>How do you do, Doctor? [<i>Puts down his hat</i>] Walked out of
a meeting. I don't like letting religion interfere with
business, but I wanted to get here before Benfield. It's
about young Gilchrist.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Shall we go into my study?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Benfield's coming here, and I've only a few minutes. Did
you know Gilchrist proposes to preach a Christmas sermon
about the strike?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>What strike?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>This garment strike. He announced his subject from the
pulpit, and Benfield's furious.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Mr. Benfield isn't interested in clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>No, but he's invested heavily in my West Virginia coal
mines, and down there we're on the verge of the biggest
walk-out in our history. You see what I mean?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>The labor problem's none of the church's business. Or any
outsider's business. It's a worrisome subject, and there's
no good stirring it up. That's what you want to tell
Gilchrist!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>I have told him ... frequently.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>And what's the answer?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>He says every problem ought to be the church's business,
and that, until the church becomes a power in live issues,
it isn't a power in life!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>He won't listen to reason?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Then he'll have to listen to something else. If he persists
about this Christmas sermon&mdash;[<span class="smcap">Barnaby</span> <i>enters

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>There's a man out there wants to see Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>What kind of a man?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indifferently</i>]: A poor man. I think he's a Jew.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist isn't here.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>I told him that, but he won't go away. I wanted to ask had

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Oh, I wouldn't do that!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Barnaby</span></p>

<p>Why don't he go over to the Synagogue instead of hanging
around a Christian Church? Mr. Gilchrist gave this fellow
his overcoat. I suppose he's come back for the gloves!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

crazy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>I've asked myself that. I've asked myself if what he saw in
France&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Exactly. A lot of young fellows go off the handle and start
out to reform the world, but this lad has run through
twenty thousand dollars in less than three months!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>In addition to his salary?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Yes. I could understand if he'd spent the money on himself,
but he hasn't! He's given it away! [<span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span>
<i>shakes his head</i>] Gilchrist's father was my first partner,
and I got the boy in here, and I feel responsible for
him. As trustee, I can refuse to turn over another penny
of his principal, and, as senior warden, I can demand
his resignation from this church. But I want him to have
every chance. Tell him if he'll get a grip on himself, and
reconsider tomorrow's sermon&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Benfield</span>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Do you know the truth, Daniel?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Yes; don't you? Doesn't every man&mdash;in his heart? And if we want to
keep it in our hearts, and never think about it or look it in the
face, shouldn't someone pry open the door and cry: "Behold"?... I
didn't tell them anything they didn't know, Doctor. I don't <em>know</em>
anything they don't know. I just reminded them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>[<i>Exploding on the last word</i>]: That we were heathen!</p>

stars! That's how all of us give&mdash;what we don't need; what we don't

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>You'd say she was crazy!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>But there's no necessity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, there is! There'll be people lying in the parks tonight. What
would Mrs. Tice say if I invited them to sleep in her pew?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>That there's no reason why she should share dirt and disease!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Exactly! We may <em>believe</em> in the brotherhood of man, but we <em>know</em>
about germs! We're not sure what is truth, but there's one thing we
<em>are</em> sure of, and <em>mean</em> to be sure of, and that's our own comfort!
You know that, and I know it, and they know it&mdash;but we mustn't say it!
All right; in God's name, what <em>are</em> we to say?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>"And on earth, Peace, good will toward men"?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>[<i>Delighted</i>]: Yes! You might say, "There are many kinds of peace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>But there aren't!</p>

<p>There is physical peace&mdash;peace that came with the end of this cruel

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>There <em>is</em> no peace! There is only fear&mdash;and hate&mdash;and vanity&mdash;and
lust, and envy, and greed&mdash;of men and nations! There are only people
preying on one another, and a hungry horde at the very doors of your

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>I don't understand.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Into his tone, hitherto indignantly human, comes something

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Don't worry. I'm quite sane. Only&mdash;I've been wondering about that for
a long time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Wondering?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>What would happen if anybody really tried to live like Christ.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking his head</i>]: It can't be done.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Isn't it worth trying? Men risk their lives&mdash;every day&mdash;in experiments
far less worth while. We've had centuries of "fear, and hate, and
greed"&mdash;and where have they brought us? Why not try love?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>How can you make them try?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>By showing that it would work.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>It <em>won't</em> work, Daniel. It's a beautiful ideal, but it won't work.
Times have changed, and things are different. Life isn't as simple as
it was two thousand years ago. The trouble with you, Daniel, is that
you're not practical.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>And the great need of the church is practical men. We mustn't take the
Scriptures too literally. We must try to interpret their spirit. And,
above all, we must please our congregations, or we shan't have any.
And then what becomes of our influence? Better fall back on my text
for tomorrow, Daniel.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I can't.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>At least, you must promise not to discuss the strike.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I can't do that, Doctor.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p>Or else let me take the pulpit.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I won't do that! [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wadham</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Nothing important.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>There will be if you insist on going around without an overcoat!
[<i>Looking at him narrowly</i>] You're too generous. [<i>He is still afar.</i>]</p>

<p>I say you're too generous! How are we going to be married if you go on
giving things away?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughs</i>]: Is generosity a fault in a husband?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>That depends. Is it true you've been giving away&mdash;well&mdash;large sums of
money?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Who told you that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>A little bird. [<i>He laughs</i>] And that you've refused to take part of
your income?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Little bird tell you that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Must have been a cuckoo!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Is it true?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>About the money? Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Well, there's the strike, and a good deal of unemployment, and I've
got so much. Why&mdash;<em>I've got you!</em></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rises</i>]: Let's not talk about it now. [<i>She turns L. Hesitates;

changed. I hardly know you. We don't seem to want the same things any
more.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>What do <em>you</em> want, Clare?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>I want to be happy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That's exactly what I want!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>How can anybody be happy without money?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>How can anybody be happy <em>with</em> it? Anyway, do you think people are?
Happier than the people who just have enough?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>In our day and age there's nothing worse than poverty! There's nothing
more degrading than having to scrimp, and save, and do without, and
keep up appearances! I've tried it ... ever since my father died ...
and I know! I can't do it any longer, and I won't!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Clare!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>[<i>She turns away, and comes back somewhat calmer</i>]: I don't want to
quarrel with you, Dan. I just want you to be sensible.... I love
you, but I love the good things of life, too. I like to be warm and
comfortable.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>You can be sure of that.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>But that's only the beginning. I want good clothes, and furs, and my
car, and money to spend when I like. I want my own house, and my own
servants, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> a husband who amounts to something. I'm no different
from other women of my class.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I hoped you were.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>A year or two ago people thought you were going to be a Bishop. Today
you've made an enemy of every influential man in the church. All that
may be very noble, but I'm not noble, and I don't pretend to be. I
don't feel any call to sacrifice myself for others, and I don't think
you have any right to ask it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I do ask it, Clare.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>You mean you're going on like this?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I mean I can't give you expensive clothes, and servants, and a big
house while all about us people are hungry.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>What do you propose to give me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>A chance to help.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>To help wash the dishes, I suppose, in a three-room flat in a side
street!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>And to visit the sick, and befriend the friendless.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>A charming prospect!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>It really is, Clare. You don't know how happy we can be with work, and
our modest plenty. There's so much to do&mdash;and they won't let me do it
here. We've got to get <em>near</em> the people in trouble, and we can't with
a big house and all that. I don't think we shall come to a three-room
flat. [<i>He smiles</i>] We'll have five or six rooms, and our books, and
each other.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>I can't believe you're serious. You've always been a dreamer, but I
can't believe you're going through with this fantastic nonsense!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I've chosen a narrow path, dear, but I hoped it might be wide enough
for us both.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>It isn't. With your means and opportunities, you're offering me what
any bank clerk would give his wife. I thought you loved me, but you're
utterly selfish, and I think a little mad. You've a right to throw
away your own life, but you've no right to throw away mine. [<i>She
hands him his ring</i>] Our engagement is off. [<i>A pause. She starts for
the door, and then hesitates, looks at her wrist watch, waits for him

you're making a terrible mistake?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looks up from the ring. Simply</i>]: No. [<span class="smcap">Clare</span> <i>turns again,

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I'm the assistant rector ... Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>I know you, Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes; I remember. You're the man who was cold. Can I do anything
for you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>I think you can.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Let's have it then.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>Perhaps I can help you, too.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>In what way?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>In my way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>My poor man, I wish you could!</p>

<p>[<i>His despair impels him to confide in anyone</i>]: I was so sure of what
I wanted to do, and now I begin to wonder if it can be done!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>It has been done.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>But in this day&mdash;in this practical world&mdash;can any man follow the
Master?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>Why not? Is this day different from any other? Was the world never
practical before? Is this the first time of conflict between flesh and
spirit? If it could be done then, why not now, and, if it was ever
worth the doing, why not now?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>But how?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>We have been told how.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>"Take no thought of the morrow.... Sell whatsoever thou hast, and give
to the poor.... Love thy neighbor as thyself.... Bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you." But if a man did those things
today people would think him mad!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>What does it matter?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>He would lose everything!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>And gain everything!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>What good can one man do?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>Why don't you try?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>He tried, and they crucified Him!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poor Man</span></p>

<p>Did they? And if they did, what does that matter? Is a man dead whose
ideal lives? Ye crucified me, but I am with ye alway, even unto the
end of the world!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>In God's name, who are you?</p>

<h2><i>ACT II.</i></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene: George F. Goodkind's</span> <i>Library. New York.</i></p>

<p><i>Ten months later. The set has only two essentials&mdash;a wide, curtained,
glass door L., and an ordinary, heavy wooden door down R. The first
gives entrance to the music room, which is indicated rather completely
when the door is open. The second, by way of a hall and a flight of
stairs, leads to the main entrance of the house. For the rest, the
library is a shallow room, very much like any other library in the
home of any other rich and well educated man. It is a little richer
and more luxurious than most, perhaps, with&mdash;here and there&mdash;priceless
things from palaces in Venice or art collections in Rome. The
obsession of business is suggested by various utilities, transient and
otherwise&mdash;a row of law books, a small file, and a pile of papers upon
the substantial library table.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">At Rise</span>: <i>It is a Saturday evening in November, 1919. The</i>
<span class="smcap">Goodkinds</span> <i>have been entertaining informally at dinner,
and, having finished the chief business of the occasion, the company
is now diverting itself in the music room. This room is brilliantly
illuminated; one sees the shadow of a man leaning against the glass
door.</i> <span class="smcap">Dilly Gilliam</span>, <i>at the piano, is playing one of the
syncopations popular at the time. After a moment, a servant, with
a card tray, enters R., crosses and exits</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<i>L. An instant later</i>,
<span class="smcap">Goodkind</span>, <i>in evening clothes, enters L. He has a card in
his hand. The</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span> <i>re-enters, re-crosses, and re-exits,
stopping, en route, to switch on the lights</i>. <span class="smcap">Goodkind</span> <i>looks
at the pile on the table, and turns the topmost paper face down</i>.
<span class="smcap">Benfield</span>, <i>also in evening clothes, enters L.</i></p>

<p>What the h&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>What are labor conciliators? Mostly thugs. When you've been director
in a coal mining company a little longer you'll know. We've got a
million dollars' worth of 'em handling this strike.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>Police duty?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>No; spies and agents provocateur. I hate the breed, but what are you
going to do about it? This fellow, Max Stedtman, got into the union
five or six years ago, and now he's one of the delegation they've sent
up to me.... Where's Jerry?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>I gave him the high sign.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Anyway, what do I know about coal mining?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>You're president of the company.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Yes, but that means digging up money&mdash;not coal. I've never set foot in
West Virginia in my life; and I don't want to!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>Yes, but in a serious situation like this&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>I sent Jerry. Jerry has a dozen qualifications and no scruples. <i>And</i>
I sent Gilchrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>Who has scruples and no qualifications.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Thus striking a balance. I mean that! Don't make any mistake about
Gilchrist. He's a valuable man. I didn't hire him because I was sorry
he got fired out of the church ... and only a little because I knew
his father. I hired him because he had theories, and I wanted to try
'em out!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>I'll say he's got theories!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Yes, and the remarkable part of it is ... sometimes they work. They
worked up at that power plant. A year ago I wouldn't have taken it as
a gift. Gilchrist applied a little soft soap&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Benfield</span></p>

<p>Soft soap or gold dust?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Well, both; but, damn it, Charlie, with all the increased wages and
decreased working hours, the plant's making money now for the first
time!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Yes. I often wonder why it wouldn't be cheaper to keep the men

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>How're you going to do it? Don't forget there are as many people paid
for stirring up strikes as for crushing 'em! Paid well, too! What the

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Why don't you give it to him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>How? By doubling his wages? The more most of 'em get
the less they want to do for it! You know that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>They've got a notion that you get rich by riding around in a limousine!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Don't you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Not often! Not unless you think while you ride ... or your father
thought for you! Even then, money doesn't stay long in bad company! To
hear those fellows you'd think there <i>wasn't</i> any work, except what's
done with a pick! The man that really produces is the man with the
idea!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>The man that produces most.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Yes, and he ought to <i>get</i> most!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>He does!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>He always will! Show me a big man and I'll show you somebody who's
done a big job! It's the little man with no capacity and no chin that
cries about a conspiracy to keep him from being President!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>There've got to be little men, too, Mr. Goodkind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>And they've got to be satisfied with little rewards! We can't all have
the same bank-roll any more than we can all have the same health!
That's where unions go wrong! When you tell a man he's going to have
the same reward, whatever he does&mdash;not because he's got ability,
but because he's got a union card&mdash;down goes the standard, out goes
incentive, and to hell goes the whole social structure!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Right!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>That's why I'm fighting the unions! Not because I want to starve
the man who works, but because I want to fire the man who doesn't
... <i>and</i> reward the man who does! I want to give every man a good
reason for doing his best! You can talk equality and democracy all
you like, Dan, but the minute the average man isn't afraid of being
fired he isn't afraid of being worthless! The minute you take away
incentive&mdash;the chance to get <i>this</i>&mdash;that minute you reduce the world
to a common level of common indifference and common futility!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Right as far as you went, but you only went part way! You have a right
to a profit on your idea, and your investment, and the labor you put
back of it! The public has a right to coal, and transportation, and
all it needs and pays for! But, above everything else, the workman who
works honestly has a right to something more than the barest kind of a
bare living ... and it can all be done if you don't sink everybody's
rights to accumulate a fortune you don't need and can't use!... All
the argument on earth can't make you <i>all</i> right so long as there's a

<p>There's no good in anything so long as we fight each other like
beasts, instead of helping each other like brothers! There's no hope

<h2><i>ACT III.</i></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: "Overcoat Hall." New York.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>This room&mdash;not too large&mdash;was the "front parlor" of a comfortable
residence in down-town New York. Business, of the least attractive
sort, and the slums long since have occupied the district. The
building is a red-brick, low-stoop, English-basement house. The rear
wall, which is the front of the dwelling, is pierced by two lofty
windows, through which are seen the top of an iron railing, and a row
of similar structures, fallen into decay, across the street. Between
these windows, upon a low marble shelf, now holding a tray of cups
and saucers, originally was a tall, gold-framed mirror. Over this
hangs a blackboard, upon which has been chalked: "And so, to the end
of history, hate shall breed hate, murder shall breed murder, until
the gods create a race that can understand." Beneath the right window
is a big radiator. Down stage R. are folding doors, partly open,
or a large single door&mdash;whichever shall prove advisable. These&mdash;or
this&mdash;lead to the main hall, and so to the basement, or upstairs, or
to the front door, which slams solidly whenever it is closed. Left is
a decrepit, white-marble mantel, with a "fake" fireplace. In front of
this&mdash;in a jog, perhaps&mdash;a small platform, of the kind used in public
schools. Upon this, a small table and a chair. Down</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
<i>stage of it, a
geographical globe, suspended over which a wall-pad informing us that
today is Wednesday. Above the mantel-shelf, another blackboard, upon
which are some simple calculations, and the axiom, "Luck is work." In
the center of the room is a long library table, with a brown cover,
and with numerous kitchen chairs about it. On the table a reading
lamp, a bowl of yellow, purple and brown chrysanthemums; and numerous
books and magazines. Gilchrist has succeeded in making the old place
comfortable and inviting. It is a combination of club, settlement
house, school, reading room and lecture hall. Brown linoleum covers
the floor, and there are brown denim curtains over the windows. A
history chart hangs on the wall. There are book-shelves, and two or
three big, comfortable chairs; a phonograph and, perhaps, even a
motion picture machine.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">At Rise</span>: <i>It is just after seven o'clock on a brisk evening
in late October, 1920.</i></p>

<p><i>Grubby, seated down stage of the center table, is concealed behind a
copy of "The Woman's Home Companion," which he has opened wide, and,
holds in front of him.</i></p>

<p><i>Mack, a shabby ne'er-do-well, between thirty and forty years old,
opens the doors R., and peers in uncertainly. Reassured by the
character of the room, he enters, and looks about him curiously. Even
from the rear, it is evident that Grubby is a person of no authority,
so Mack dismisses him, temporarily, and warms his hands over the
radiator. Next he inspects the quotation</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
<i>between the windows, pauses
at the phonograph, and arrives in front of the platform L. The three
words on this blackboard interest him. He reads them, turns away,
turns back, and reads them again. At last, he sniffs contemptuously,
and, completing his circuit, stops on the left of Grubby.</i></p>

<p>What's <i>your</i> job?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mack</span></p>

<p>Well, I was in the movies. That is, I was going to be, but the fellow
that was going to put up the money, his mother didn't die, after
all.... Before that, I sold bricks ... a few weeks. I sold books, too.
And life insurance. I never had any luck. Who wrote that, "Luck is
Work"?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Grubby</span></p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mack</span></p>

<p>Well, it isn't! I've worked at <i>fifty</i> things, and look at me! I

<p>He will if he's got one.</p>

<p>I suppose a hard-luck story's the proper spiel.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Grubby</span></p>

<p>You don't get no chance for a spiel. He don't ask you nothing. You
just come, and help yourself, and talk things over ... if you want
to. Coffee and sandwiches every night&mdash;and suppers and sermons on
Wednesdays.</p>

<p>Preaching! [<i>Looks at the wall pad, and reaches for his hat.</i>]
Wednesday. I'll be back Thursday.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Grubby</span></p>

to me, the other night, he says, "You're a good man yet, Grubby," he
says. "You're strong and healthy," he says, "and, if you learned to
drive a taxi, all the best people in New York would be telephoning for
your cab. I'll lend you the money," he says. Gee; he almost had me
started!</p>

yesterday, and he was desprit! He ain't had money to get himself a
pair of shoes, and nobody helps him, or comes near him, but you bums
that roast him behind his back! [<span class="smcap">Goodkind</span> <i>appears in the

<p>I'm so glad you said so. [<span class="smcap">Mack</span> <i>shows surprise</i>.] Because,
if you hadn't and I hadn't understood, you might have been tempted to

he? And, of course, if we're going to pull ourselves together, and get

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>You couldn't.... It's your coat.... You asked for it, and I gave it

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Is <i>her</i> business!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>And <i>his</i>! Only Jerry's in no condition to settle the matter! He's

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That's your mistake.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Is it? A year ago you gave me twenty-four hours to sign a paper, and I

<p>Then we'll file a petition to have you declared incompetent! [<i>He

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Mr. Goodkind, you don't, mean that! You don't mean that because I'm

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Help ... whom? Strikers, and street women, and general riff-raff!
And you don't even help <i>them</i> ... because nobody <i>can</i>! And, if

<p>[<i>Sitting at table</i>]: Supper with Cinderella!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>Setting dish before him</i>]: Gee, I love that story! [<i>She sits beside
him, facing front.</i>] When you tell it to me, you make me believe I'm
her.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>If you believe it ... you <i>are</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>I guess believin' ain't never goin' to make <i>me</i> dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>You can't tell ... if you believe hard enough.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>That's what you said before, and I've tried, but, somehow, it don't
work.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That's the very time to go on. If we stop, just because it don't work,
that isn't faith.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>No; I s'pose not.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>And faith moves mountains. Once upon a time there was a woman who'd
been sick twelve years.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>What was the matter with her?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I don't know. But there was a Man in that city who said He could
even make the dead rise. And everybody laughed at Him ... as they
would today. But the woman didn't laugh, and one morning, when He was
passing her house, she got up and followed Him ... just to touch the
hem of His cloak. And what do you think?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>I duno.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>She was cured. And the Man said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, now, I know. "Thy faith hath made thee whole."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That's right.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Could God do that for me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>It would be an awful big favor.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>But if He doesn't, you must go on. If faith doesn't heal our hurts, it
helps us to bear them. And that's almost the same thing, isn't it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>Doubtfully</i>]: Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Like believing you're Cinderella.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>We can't decide what we want, and then be angry and doubtful because
it doesn't happen our way. Because, all the time it's happening His
way. The only thing we can be sure of is that He knows what's best.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>That's right.... You mean, if God wants me to be well, some day He'll
make me well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>And if He don't?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Then <i>that's</i> right ... if you believe hard enough.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

women ... from the beginning! All kinds of women! <i>That</i> woman,
salesgirls, stenographers, women of our own class! Do you remember ...
in your church ... a Mrs. Thornbury? He's been quite open about <i>her</i>!
Tonight we were going out to dinner! He came to my room ... drunk ...
and babbled that he'd refused to go until she was invited! Then <i>I</i>
refused to go, and he accused me ... <i>of you</i> ... and struck me with
his fist!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Yes. And then he tried to take me in his arms! Night after night he's
come to me ... drunk ... and held me in his arms. And I said once
there was nothing more degrading than poverty! In the past two years

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>And for them you'd send me back to degradation?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That little girl's known degradation that you and I will never know.
And she's singing. Her constant companions are poverty and pain. And
she's singing. She's crippled. She may never walk again. And still she
can say God's will be done. She believes in me. I can't disappoint her

<p>You think <i>that's</i> God's will?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Must I go on forever paying for one mistake?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Somebody must pay for our mistakes. That it was wrong to make a
bargain doesn't make it right to break the bargain when we get tired
of it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>I don't know what to do.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Play the game. Go back to that poor, mistaken man lying across the
foot of your bed&mdash;his mind going and his health gone. Bear your
punishment and help him to bear his. That's your duty!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Duty! Duty!! What about happiness?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>There <i>is</i> no other happiness. Oh, don't you see, my dear, <i>that's</i>
been your <i>great</i> mistake? You're always crying&mdash;you and the world&mdash;"I
want to be happy!" Happiness is service! Happiness is clean-living,
and clear-thinking, and self-forgetfulness, and self-respect!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>And love?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Love <i>isn't</i> all. Not the love you mean. You said: "Take me, and
we'll both forget." Could we have forgotten promises unkept, faith
disappointed, aspirations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> unrealized? No, my dear, love isn't all;
nor even happiness. There's something bigger, and better, and more
important, and that something is ... DUTY!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>The world doesn't think that!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That's what's wrong with the world! [<i>A pause.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clare</span></p>

<p>Well, then ... I'm going through. I'm going back, and play the game

<p>Pants. I took out a spot ... with gasoline ... and hung 'em on the

<h2><i>ACT IV.</i></h2>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Gilchrist's Room&mdash;"Upstairs."<br />
Two months later.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>The room is cheerful. That is its chief aspect. Cheerful, and
comfortable, and homelike. Such a room ... in the rear of the fourth
story ... might be had anywhere for seven dollars a week, and its
contents duplicated for a couple of hundred, yet no one should be
able to look in without envying the occupant. Before the warm glow
of a fireplace down R. is a big, brown leather-covered armchair. An
electric lamp stands on a table stage left of the chair and squarely
opposite the fireplace. There are books on the table, too, and writing
things, and another chair on its left. Above the grate a picture of
Christ in the Temple. Conspicuous in the flat, and visible from all
parts of the house, a big studio window. There are cream-colored
outside curtains, and brown denim inside curtains, drawn now, but when
they are pulled aside, one sees chimney-pots, and roof-tops, and a
blue night-sky, with one particularly bright star. Up L., a curtained
arch into a hall bedroom, and down L. a door. The walls, covered
with old-gold grass-cloth, are hidden, to a height of six feet, by
roughly-built bookcases, filled with much-used books. A sofa, against
the wall</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
<i>L., now holds numerous packages. There is a brown-and-tan
grass rug on the floor, and there may be a window seat, with brown
cushions, beneath the window. The furniture is all old ... probably
second-hand ... but, as aforesaid, the room suggests comfort and
peace.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">At Rise</span>: <i>It is just after eight o'clock, Christmas Eve,
1920.</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span> <i>is discovered, dreaming, in the armchair R.,
a pipe in his mouth and his face to the fire. He has not lighted the
desk lamp, and, except for the glow of the embers, the room is in
darkness. Hanging over the left arm of the chair</i>, <span class="smcap">Daniel's</span>
<i>hand holds a magazine, but he has not begun reading. After a pause
long enough for the audience to take in his surroundings, there is a
light tap at the door and, without waiting for a response</i>, <span class="smcap">Mary
Margaret</span> <i>enters. She walks without crutches&mdash;quite briskly&mdash;but
plainly is on some secret business. Daniel is lost in the darkness.
A package in her hand</i>, <span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span> <i>crosses quickly to
the table, and turns on one and then the other of the two lights in
the lamp. Instantly, of course, she sees the figure in the chair, and
conceals the package beneath her apron.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist? [<i>He shows himself</i>] Goo'ness, how you scared me! I

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>He promised to help with the packages.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Grubby's all swelled up with his new taxicab. Christmas Eve's the big
night in his business, but he says don't worry ... he'll be here in
time for the sandwiches. Am I interruptin' your readin'?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Oh, no! What have you there?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Under your apron.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p>[<i>She reveals the parcel</i>] I was gonna surprise you. It's your
Christmas present.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>From you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>Handing it across the table</i>]: Yes. It ain't much ... <i>you</i> know ...

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Mary Margaret!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>The name's on the back! [<i>He turns it around, revealing to the

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>It's just what I wanted.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>Delighted</i>]: Is it ... honest?... Let's put it in place of that one
over the mantel-piece! That's an awful pretty pitcher, but mine's got
colors in it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Why not in place of the Venus who fell on her nose?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes! [<i>She stands "Mama's Treasure" atop a bookcase L.</i>] It looks
good, don't it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Beautiful. I can't thank you enough. [<i>Takes her hand</i>] I can't really.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p><i>You</i> can't thank <i>me</i>! You that's give me&mdash;[<i>She looks down at her

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Now! Now! Now! We mustn't cry on Christmas!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>What're you going to do if you're happy?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Try laughing. [<i>She does</i>] Anyway, if I'm having my Christmas now, you
must have yours. Suppose you rummage on the sofa.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>Oh! [<i>She runs to obey, and holds up a parcel inquiringly.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That's a book for Miss Levinson.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reads from another bundle</i>]: Mrs. Henchley. [<i>Takes up a third</i>]
This one ain't marked.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Gloves for Mack. I wanted to show I appreciated his bringing back that
coat.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reading from two packages</i>]: Peter ... Paul....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>For your brothers.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a fourth</i>]: And ... Mary Margaret!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Open it now.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>[<i>Breathless, she comes to him C. Hesitates, and

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Now! [<i>She remembers, and laughs.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>I don't know how to thank you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Don't try.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>I never expected no such a Christmas! [<i>Starts for door</i>] I gotta show

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>I'll be back in a minute! [<i>She opens the door, disclosing</i>
<span class="smcap">Goodkind</span>. <i>Seriously alarmed</i>] Oh!... Mr. Gilchrist!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning L.</i>]: Well ... Mr. Goodkind!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>May I come in?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Of course! [<i>He enters. Dan indicates chair L. of table R.</i>] Sit down!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>I've only a moment. Jerry's waiting for me in the car.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>How is Jerry? [<span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span> <i>arranges the chair</i>.]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shakes his head despairingly. Looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span>]: I

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I wish I could.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dan</span>]: Had a doctor look her over?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Three of 'em.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Any opinion?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Three opinions.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>They said <i>he</i> didn't do it, and you seen him!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Holds up a warning finger</i>]: <i>Ssh!</i> [<i>Then to</i> <span class="smcap">Goodkind</span>]
They all say she suffered from hysterical paraplegia.
[<span class="smcap">Goodkind</span> <i>puzzled</i>] Hysterical paralysis. One says she was
cured by shock&mdash;you know; the riot. Another says it was suggestion
... believing ... which is another way of saying faith, isn't it? The
important thing is that she's cured!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>God did it&mdash;God and Mr. Gilchrist!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hushing her again</i>]: Take down an armful of those packages ... like

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mary Margaret</span></p>

<p>I will. [<i>She gathers them up, and, returning L. C., looks

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Thanks. [<i>Showing his pipe</i>] I'll stick to my old friend. [<i>He sits.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>How are things with you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Enthusiastically</i>]: Fine!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Happy?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>[<i>Radiantly</i>]: Yes!... And you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>No. Everything's ... all wrong. My boy's very ill. Clare's wonderful
to him. I can't explain it&mdash;she's like a different woman. And <i>she</i>
seems happy. But Jerry's had to give up work, and there's more trouble
in Black River, and that's what brought me!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>You don't want <i>my</i> advice?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>I want <i>you</i> ... as general manager. These strikes are such utter
damned waste! We had a working compromise on your agreement, and
everything was all right, but we began figuring we could make more
money ... and the men walked out, and flooded the mines. I'd like you
to take charge, Daniel.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I can't.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Name your own salary.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>My work is here.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>You can have anything you want.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I don't want anything.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>You want to see the men get their rights.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>They'll get 'em. Nothing can stop that.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>You're not going to turn down fifty thousand dollars a year?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>What can I buy with it that I haven't got?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>What can you buy with fifty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>What have <i>you</i> bought?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>I've got one of the finest houses in New York!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Is it any more comfortable than this?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>This one little room!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>How many rooms do you live in at the same time?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>I've got half a dozen cars!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>I've two legs, and I walk, and keep well.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>I've twenty servants&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Don't tell me you enjoy that!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>And the respect of people about me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>So have I!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>And, what's most important of all, I'm a success!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Are you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Are you? What is success? Money? Yes; that's what our civilization
tells us. Money! But where has that brought us? Only to the elevation
of the unfit ... the merely shrewd and predatory. All around us
we see men of wealth who have nothing else ... neither health nor
happiness nor love nor respect. Men who can get no joy out of books,
or pictures, or music, or even themselves. Tired, worried men who
are afraid to quit because they have no resource except to make
money&mdash;money with which to buy vulgar excitement for their own debased
souls. Why, Mr. Goodkind, I have an income that you wouldn't suggest
to your bookkeeper, but I have peace, and health, and friends, and
time to read, and think, and dream, and help. Which of us is the rich
man?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>But if everybody lived your way, what would become of the world's
work?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>Living that way is my contribution to the world's work. Another man's
might be selling shoes, or writing plays, or digging ditches. Doing
his job doesn't prevent any man from doing his bit. "From every man
according to his ability, to every man according to his needs." And
every man who gives his best must find his happiness.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Goodkind</span></p>

<p>I'm afraid there wouldn't be much progress ... living your way.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel</span></p>

<p>That's the second time you've spoken of my way. It isn't <i>my</i> way.
It's the sum total of all that has been learned and taught. You,
and Jerry, and the others have called me eccentric, and a fool,
because I'm trying to walk a path trod hard by countless feet. Was
Christ eccentric? Was Confucius a fool? And how about Buddha and
Mohammed? What of St. Bernard, and St. Teresa, and St. Francis of
Assisi&mdash;of Plato, and Zeno, and Lincoln, and Emerson, and Florence
Nightingale, and Father Damien, and Octavia Hill, and all the saints
and scientists, and poets and philosophers, who have lived and died
in complete forgetfulness of self? Were they fools, or were they wise
men and women who had found the way to peace and happiness? Were
they failures, or were they the great successes of all Time and all
Eternity?</p>
